## Usage

1. Import all files from:
   - `ROM/system` → into your system partition  
   - `ROM/vendor` → into your vendor partition  

2. Add the required properties from `ROM/build.prop` to your device’s `build.prop`.  

3. Place `framework.jar` inside the `framework_patcher` folder.  

4. Run the patcher:
   ```sh
   ./patchframework.sh
   ```

5. Wait for the patching process to complete.  

6. Replace your system’s `framework.jar` with the patched version.  

7. Remove any files in system/framework named:
   ```
   boot-framework.*
   ```

## Notes
- framework.jar patch script is only for Linux x86_64. Android is not supported.
- This implementation will be updated whenever Google changes Play Integrity.  
- `PIF.apk` is updated if keys/properties get banned, just run `pif-updater`.
- Some of those Implementation Features is adjusted via PIF.apk bools/strings, so no need to worry about that.. i'll only enable and disable whats important for passing play integrity.
* On devices running **SELinux Enforcing**, you may need to integrate additional SELinux rules for `pif-updater`. See the full guide below:
